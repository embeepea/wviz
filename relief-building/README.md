The elevation data file that I used here, namely

    ned19_n35x75_w082x50_nc_statewide_2003.img
    
is not included in this repo because it's 264MB in size.  However, it
can be downloaded from http://nationalmap.gov/elevation.html.  Specifically,
the above *.img file is included in the following zip file:
