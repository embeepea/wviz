/**
 * event_emitter supports basic event emitting / handling
 *
 * Events are represented as plain old JavaScript objects with at least
 * the following two properties:
 *
 *   **type**
 *
 *   > a string giving the type of the event; this can be any
 *     arbitrary string.  The event type is not restricted to be
 *     from some predetermined list; applications are free to
 *     use whatever strings they want for their event types.
 *
 *   **target**
 *
 *   > a reference to the object that emitted the event
 *
 * Event objects may also contain arbitrary other properties that are specific to
 * a particular event type.
 *
 * Any object can be declared to be an event_emitter by calling
 *   event_emitter(obj)
 *
 * This adds a property to the object called "listeners", and three methods:
 *  
 *   **addListener(eventType, listenerFunction)**
 *
 *   > Registers listenerFunction as a listener for events of type
 *     eventType (a string).  listenerFunction should be a function
 *     that accepts a single argument which will be a reference to an
 *     event object as described above.  When the object emits the
 *     event, the listener function will be invoked in the context
 *     where its "this" keyword refers to the object that emitted the
 *     event (the event target).  If listenerFunction is already
 *     registered as a listener for eventType, this function does
 *     nothing --- each listener function can be registered only once.
 *
 *   **removeListener(eventType, listenerFunction)**
 *
 *   > Removes the given listenerFunction from the list of listeners
 *     for this object for events of type eventType.
 *
 *   **emit(event)**
 *
 *   > Causes the object to emit the given event.  The argument can be
 *     either a string, in which case it is assumed to be an event type
 *     and is converted to an event object with the given 'type'
 *     property, or an event object with a 'type' property and any
 *     other desired properties.  The emit() method automatically adds
 *     a 'target' property to the event object, whose value is a
 *     reference to the object emitting the event.
 *
 * In most cases the emit() method is only called from within the
 * implementation of an EventEmitter object, and code external to the
 * object's model will use its addListener() and removeListener() methods
 * to process events that the object emits.  All three of these methods
 * are public methods, though, so it's also possible for code outside of
 * an object's implementation to cause it to emit an event, or for the
 * object's own code to listen for and process its own events.
 *
 * Two special types of events are always present for every EventEmitter
 * object: the "listenerAdded" and "listenerRemoved" events.  These
 * events make it possible to monitor the addition or removal of event
 * listeners.  The "listenerAdded" event is emitted whenever a new
 * listener function is added, and the "listenerRemoved" event is emitted
 * whenever a listener is removed.  Each of these events contain the
 * following properties:
 *
 *   **targetType**
 *
 *   > the event type associated with the listener
 *     being added or removed
 *
 *   **listener**
 *
 *   > the listener function being added or removed
 *
 * Example:
 *    var event_emitter = require('./event_emitter.js');
 *    
 *    var person = {
 *        name: "Mark",
 *        say: function(something) {
 *            console.log(this.name + ' says ' + something);
 *            this.emit({type: "say", message: something});
 *        }
 *    };
 *    event_emitter(person);
 *    var sayListener = function(event) {
 *        console.log(event.target.name + ' said ' + event.message);
 *    };
 *    
 *    person.say('Hello');
 *    person.addListener("say", sayListener);
 *    person.say('Alright');
 *    person.removeListener("say", sayListener);
 *    person.say('Goodbye');
 *    
 *    OUTPUT:
 *    
 *      Mark says Hello
 *      Mark says Alright
 *      Mark said Alright
 *      Mark says Goodbye
